## Hi there, I'm Khadija 👋

Final year Computer Science + Artificial Intelligence <br>
Interested in FinTech, data-driven problem solving, and creating practical technical solutions.<br>
Currently building my portfolio for early-career roles in FinTech and AI, where adaptability, digital competency and creative problem solving are essential.<br>

I enjoy building things quickly, learning through real applications, and using AI tools to improve how I work. This portfolio highlights three Kingston Graduate Attributes I focused on developing this year: Digital Competency, Adaptability, and Creative Problem Solving <br>
and how they shape the kind of professional I want to become.<br>

**💬 Creative Problem Solving**<br>
Developed through: British Airways Virtual Data Science Simulation<br>
-Worked through real forecasting tasks with incomplete information.<br>
-Learned to justify decisions using evidence rather than waiting for a 'perfect' answer.<br>
-Built confidence in approaching open-ended problems — something essential in fast-moving FinTech environments where ambiguity is normal.<br>
How this shapes my future work:<br>
I now feel more confident reasoning through complex situations, explaining my choices clearly, and experimenting with different solutions when the path isn’t obvious. This directly supports the rapid, iterative problem-solving expected in FinTech roles.<br>

**⚡Digital Competency**<br>
Developed through: IBM SkillsBuild - Getting Started with AI<br>
-Strengthened my understanding of AI tools and how they can support real work.<br>
-Applied concepts to hands-on tasks rather than only learning theory.<br>
-Built confidence using digital tools quickly, which matches the pace expected in tech and FinTech roles.<br>
How this shapes my future work:<br>
Digital tools feel less overwhelming now. I’m quicker at understanding new systems and more willing to experiment and learn independently. This aligns with the technical agility FinTech teams prioritise.<br>

**👯Adaptability**<br>
Developed through: Santander Open Academy: Lead with Impact<br>
-Learned how to adjust communication styles, respond to different working approaches, and stay flexible during challenges.<br>
-Reflected on how I react under pressure and where I need to build confidence.<br>
-Became more aware of moments where I underestimate myself or hold back from contributing.<br>
How this shapes my future work:<br>
Adaptability helps me work better in unfamiliar situations, whether that’s a new tech stack, a changing project, or a fast-paced FinTech startup environment. Adaptability is essential in FinTech, where priorities and technologies shift quickly.<br>

**🤔Where I’m Going Next**<br>
Through these experiences, I’ve realised that I learn fastest by doing, and that I enjoy the mix of technical work and real-world problem solving. My goal is to keep building technical depth, improve how I communicate my ideas, and take on opportunities that strengthen my confidence in professional settings. <br>
