## Hi there, I'm Khadija 👋

Final year Computer Science + Artificial Intelligence 
Interested in FinTech, data-driven problem solving, and creating practical technical solutions.
Currently building my portfolio for early-career roles in FinTech and AI, where adaptability, digital competency and creative problem solving are essential.

I enjoy building things quickly, learning through real applications, and using AI tools to improve how I work. This portfolio highlights three Kingston Graduate Attributes I focused on developing this year: Digital Competency, Adaptability, and Creative Problem Solving 
and how they shape the kind of professional I want to become.

###💬 Creative Problem Solving
Developed through: British Airways Virtual Data Science Simulation
-Worked through real forecasting tasks with incomplete information.
-Learned to justify decisions using evidence rather than waiting for a “perfect” answer.
-Built confidence in approaching open-ended problems — something essential in fast-moving FinTech environments where ambiguity is normal.
**How this shapes my future work:**
I now feel more confident reasoning through complex situations, explaining my choices clearly, and experimenting with different solutions when the path isn’t obvious. This directly supports the rapid, iterative problem-solving expected in FinTech roles.

###⚡Digital Competency
Developed through: IBM SkillsBuild - Getting Started with AI
-Strengthened my understanding of AI tools and how they can support real work.
-Applied concepts to hands-on tasks rather than only learning theory.
-Built confidence using digital tools quickly, which matches the pace expected in tech and FinTech roles.
**How this shapes my future work:**
Digital tools feel less overwhelming now. I’m quicker at understanding new systems and more willing to experiment and learn independently. This aligns with the technical agility FinTech teams prioritise.

###👯Adaptability
Developed through: Santander Open Academy: Lead with Impact
-Learned how to adjust communication styles, respond to different working approaches, and stay flexible during challenges.
-Reflected on how I react under pressure and where I need to build confidence.
-Became more aware of moments where I underestimate myself or hold back from contributing.
**How this shapes my future work:**
Adaptability helps me work better in unfamiliar situations, whether that’s a new tech stack, a changing project, or a fast-paced FinTech startup environment. Adaptability is essential in FinTech, where priorities and technologies shift quickly.

###🤔Where I’m Going Next
Through these experiences, I’ve realised that I learn fastest by doing, and that I enjoy the mix of technical work and real-world problem solving. My goal is to keep building technical depth, improve how I communicate my ideas, and take on opportunities that strengthen my confidence in professional settings.
